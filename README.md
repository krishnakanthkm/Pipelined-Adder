# Pipelined-Adder
Pipelined adder handles 4 bit addition in each clock cycle. It is built using ripple carry adder and carry select adder. The systemverilog code is simulated and synthesized. The design is made to operate at 800 MHz and the positive slack in synthesis report indicates that the timing requirement is met.
